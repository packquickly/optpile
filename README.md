# optpile
A collection of nonlinear programming problems for benchmarking optimisation software in JAX.

The API is a work in progress, and subject to change.

Optpile pulls from a number of optimisation test problem collections, principally "Testing Unconstrained Optimization Software" by Mor√©, Garbow, and Hillstrom, "An Unconstrained Optimization Test Functions Collection" by Andrei, "A Literature Survey of Benchmark Functions for Global Optimization Problems" by Jamil and Yan, A Numerical Evaluation of Several Stochastic Algorithms on Selected Continuous Global Optimization Test Problems." by Ali, et al., and "Constrained and Unconstrained Testing Environment" by Gould, Orban, and Toint. A funny side-effect of this is the repetition of many loss functions resembling the [Rosenbrock function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function); it seems optimisation researchers are creative in creating small permutations of this problem. The downside is a lack of truly challenging problems: you will find many ill-behaved toy functions but few problems that replicate the high-dimensional challenges of deep learning or complex scientific model calibration.
